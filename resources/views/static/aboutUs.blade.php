    <h1>The Bulletin - About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to The Bulletin! We are a group of 3rd year students from FEUP, who passionately built this website in the context of our LBAW class, we hope to have made a site where you can read and share news you find interesting, comment and debate with other people, and just overall have a great time.</p>
